<div class="intro">
		<p>So you've found my blog I guess. Good for you, bad for me. This actually means I need to put some work into this now. :P<br />
		As you explicitly want to hear something about me, I'm going to tell you.</p>
		<p>My name is Alexander (or Alex in short) Oberl√§nder. I was born on the 21st of September 1996 in Berlin, Germany where I still live today.<br />
		I currently work as a junior software developer at PLT GmbH in Berlin and do my apprenticeship there. Previously I've been going to Technical University of Berlin, but it sucked so hard I needed to change.<br />
		In my free-time I enjoy reading manga and doing some mod work for r/WiiUHacks. I also enjoy programming and am somewhat proficient in C#, HTML, CSS, ELM, C and Python. You can also find me on Twitter, documenting my development status on Wii U projects I work on currently.</p>
		<p>If you're interested in what I mainly use for developing, I need to answer in two ways: At work I develop using Windows, however personall I prefer Linux because of it being FOSS(Free and Open-Source Software). I discovered Solus to be the best by far, coming from Arch before, because it's in active development (as in really, really active) while still being beautiful.<br />
		I really do not like Ubuntu and that sort because of how they do things, but that's just my point of view.</p>
		<p>That should be enough for the time being. I have an open PM system on Twitter and Reddit, so feel free to contact me anytime and ask me some questions. I also check my email regularly, but you need to ask for that ;)</p>
