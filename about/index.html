<div class="intro">
	<p>So you've found my blog I guess. Good for you, bad for me. This actually means I need to put some work into this now. :P<br />
	As you explicitly want to hear something about me, I'm going to tell you.</p>
	<p>My name is Alexander (or Alex in short) Oberl√§nder. I was born on the 21st of September 1996 in Berlin, Germany where I still live today.<br />
	I currently work as a junior software developer at PLT GmbH in Berlin and do my apprenticeship there. Previously I've been going to Technical University of Berlin, but it sucked so hard I needed to change.<br />
	In my free-time I enjoy reading manga and doing some mod work for r/WiiUHacks. I also enjoy programming and am somewhat proficient in C#, HTML, CSS, ELM, C and Python. You can aso find me on Twitter, documenting my development status on Wii U projects I work on currently. As for how I started, you can read about that in the blog post.</p>
