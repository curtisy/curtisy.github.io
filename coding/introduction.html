	<h1>Learn programming - A somewhat different approach</h1>
	<p>Hey there, welcome to the programming section of my website. Here you'll hopefully learn what it means to be a programmer.</p>
	<p>I've chosen a fairly different approach at actually getting the content to you that I believe has way more effect than just doing the plain old rinse and repeat learning. What I am trying to get you to learn is multiple programming languages at once with guided examples from
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/1">99 Prolog Problems</a>.
	That way I hope you not only get basic understanding of how one language works, but rather the different concepts behind a few of those, as well as their similarities.<br />
	This also allows anyone to steadily progress at their own pace, previous experience or not. You can either learn with my example solutions or solve them independently and then compare to my result. The main goal is that you actually learn something while having fun.</p>
	<p>That should be it for a short introduction. Let's get our hands dirty with the first introductory example, shall we?</p>
