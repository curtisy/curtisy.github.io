<div class="block">
	<h2>Hey Nia, it's Alex</h2>
	<p>I know I said you should get back to me if you ever changed your mind about continuing to chat and being friends, but truth be told: I can't live on with things like this being around (not in a suicidal way).<br />
	So me being a developer and all, I wanted to make this a little more appealing than just a simple apology and so I made what you read now. To be honest, I didn't put any effort into this, I just thought I'd order my thoughts and clear my head a little when doing this as well as make yet another effort on speaking in a reasonable way with you (although seeing you actually got 6 beers in 2 days I don't think there's much I can change now anyways).</p>

	<p>So let me start by saying I still don't understand why you suddenly became so obsessed with quitting our friendship and all, not the tiniest bit to be precise. I can think of three reasons that might apply though:
		<ul>
			<li>1. Me being a dick and not noticing when to stop. However I apologized for my behavior countless times, so you really can't hold that against me. Even now I won't mention the exact issue so you can see I mean it when I promise something.</li> <br>
			<li>2. You fearing being hurt by me again (in whatever aspect) or you not wanting to hurt me. This might be a bit far fetched but I think my theory about your issues was pretty much on point. Again I won't go into detail because it's your personal stuff and not for the whole world to see but you should know what I’m talking about.</li><br>
			<li>3. Both of us completely misunderstanding the whole situation. Although I believe this is not the case, it would be the easiest and silliest of things.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Now I wouldn't be me if I wouldn't at least try to resolve these problems so here's a few solutions:
		<ul>
			<li>1. I can't do anything about that. It happened and I apologized for it, nothing more I could actually do than what I’m doing right now or walking across the Alps to apologize in person (which I won't do). So if this is the only reason, as I said the decision is all yours. Get back to me where ever you want if you're ready. I’ll just wait for all eternity with an uneasy mind.</li><br>
			<li>2. Seriously, your move was pretty ugly so I would like you to apologize to me and properly explain what you are/were on about. Quitting a friendship is not a decision you make out of a mood in a split second, I hold that against you. However I don't think you're a bad person. You're just a girl trying to find a way to live life so that it's still fun in the future, similar to me.</li><br>
			<li>To be fair, I would appreciate this case because we probably both overreacted. In this case, talking it out should be enough (without pressure)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>So with this I either bid you farewell forever and our ways part here already which would make me a bit sad. Or we can get over this fight the proper way, by giving all of this another chance. I think I did my part with this and put my faith and hopes in you entirely now.<br />Yes, I don't know your name, nor do I know how you look. I actually don't know anything about you but we still got along wonderfully most of the time so I think it's in both of our interest not to part ways now. I would even propose to you under the above conditions if it weren't for the way this turned out and if I actually wanted to be more than friends (but I’m still a pirate), just because you're a fun, reasonable person to be with that makes my day a little brighter in the evening.</p> 
	<p>If you read all of that, you will probably have made up your mind by now so I would like you to answer this question for one last time or as a new start depending on the answer. Answer where you see fit, but please at least answer.</p>
	<h3>Will you <div class="imacompleteidiot" style="text-decoration: line-through;">(marry me)</div> give our friendship another chance?</h3>
	<form class="decisionbox">
		<input type="radio" id="yes" name="decision" value="Yes">
    		<label for="yes"> Yes</label> <br />
    	<input type="radio" id="no" name="decision" value="No">
    		<label for="no"> No</label><br>
    	<input type="radio" id="maybe" name="decision" value="Maybe">
    		<label for="maybe"> Yes, but… (insert reason here)</label>
	</form>
	<p>Unrelated to your answer or whether you're still online here, I’ll also buy you a diamond as a final sign of goodwill and apology although I know you won't like it.<br />
	(P.S. the buttons don't actually do anything, I just wanted to make this a little more realistic)</p>
